# Week 4 — Guided Build (Starter)

This folder is the **starter** for the Week 4 guided build.

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step).

## What you will build

By editing `styles.css`, you will implement:

1) `.site-nav` as a wrapping flex row (`display: flex`, `flex-wrap`, `gap`)
2) `.layout` as a simple grid container (stacked by default)
3) `.card-grid` as a responsive grid gallery (`auto-fit` + `minmax`)
4) One breakpoint (recommended: `900px`) that makes list + detail side-by-side
5) One subtle motion cue + a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback

## Compare with the finished demo
